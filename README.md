# PragmaBeerTruck

A system to monitor beers containers temperature. 

This application simulates a refrigerated truck responsible for delivery beer. Every beer has a specific minimum and maximum temperature that have to be respected to guarantee its quality. It is important to verify the containers' temperature because every time that the truck's doors are open the containers' temperature goes up.
